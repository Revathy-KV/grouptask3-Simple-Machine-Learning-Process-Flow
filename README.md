# Simple Machine Learning Process Flow

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a **Group Task** on building a **Simple Machine Learning Process Flow**.  
The project explains the complete workflow of a machine learning system starting from data collection to model evaluation.

The objective is to understand each stage involved in developing a machine learning model and how these stages are interconnected.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To explain the fundamental steps in a machine learning process
- To understand the importance of data collection and feature extraction
- To describe model training, testing, and evaluation stages
- To present machine learning as an iterative process

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Process Stages
1. Data Collection  
2. Feature Extraction  
3. Algorithm Selection  
4. Training  
5. Testing  
6. Evaluation  

If evaluation results are not satisfactory, the process loops back to earlier stages, making machine learning an iterative cycle.
